# Clock
This is a project that I started after finding [this awesome clock](https://clockclock.com/) on reddit. It seemed like a fun project to learn about embeded systems and a good excuse to finally get a 3D printer.

This is still very much a work in progress but as I progress more parts will show up here.

## Progress
- [ ] CAD of the parts needed for the clock
- [ ] Arduino code to control the stepper motors
- [ ] Raspberry Pi code to control the indipendent Arduninos?
